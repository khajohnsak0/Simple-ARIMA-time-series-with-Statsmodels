# Simple-ARIMA-time-series-with-Statsmodels

I have created a simple baseline ARIMA time series model with Statsmodels library. You're welcome to tune and change model's hyperparameters or use SARIMA version.

The data are from 1962-1975 years, published at DataMarket: https://datamarket.com/data/set/22ox/monthly-milk-production-pounds-per-cow-jan-62-dec-75#!ds=22ox&display=line. It contains time series data of milk produced in pounds per cow for every day.
